This Java program uses two classes in addition to a Client or controlling class, to provide a calculation 
of the funds necessary to aid in the event of a disaster, in any part of the world.

This program is made up of an Allocation class which uses the Location abstract class to get the name, 
population, and cost of any country in a simulated natural disaster. The Location class is used to house 
helper methods for generating the location and cost of repairing a country.
